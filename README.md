# üçï Pizza Toppings Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on pizza toppings detection using various machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset consists of **real pizza images**, and we explore different methodologies for feature extraction and multilabel prediction.

## Status
* Data preparation + some statistics about data (OK)
* ResNet + Classifier (WIP)
   * Random Forest
   * SVM
   * KNN
   * Perceptron
* Pre-trained CNN + MLP (TODO)
   * ResNext + MLP
   * AlexNet + MLP
   * Learning AlexNet + MLP
   * VGG + MLP
* CNN from scratch (TODO)
* Fine Tuning (TODO)
   * EfficientNet
* Compare it with CLAP OpenAI (TODO)
* Bonus: Deep learning
* Bonus: Same with the synthetic images

_(comment: use all methods learned in TDs)_

## Dataset
**Real Pizza Images:** A collection of images showcasing pizzas with different toppings.
