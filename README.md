# üçï Pizza Toppings Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on pizza toppings detection using various machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset consists of **synthetic pizza images**, and we explore different methodologies for feature extraction and multilabel prediction.

## Status
* Data preparation + some statistics about data (OK)
* CNN (OK)
* EfficientNet (OK)
* Feature Extraction (OK)
* ResNet + Classifier
   * Random Forest (OK)
   * Perceptron (OK)
* Compare it with CLAP OpenAI (TODO)
* Bonus: Deep learning
* Bonus: Same with the real images

_(comment: use all methods learned in TDs)_

## Dataset
**Synthetic Pizza Images:** A collection of images showcasing pizzas with different toppings.
